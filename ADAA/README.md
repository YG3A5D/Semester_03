1.     Implementing the Merge Sort Algorithm in c/ c++ and its Analysis using Back Substitution Method for every Function (including merge function) 

2.     Implementing the Quick Sort Algorithm in c/ c++ and its Analysis using Back Substitution Method for ascending and descending order Arrays

3.     Write a Program to implement Integer Multiplication using Divide and Conquer. 

4.     Write a Program using greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of notes that could makeup to the given sum. Take denomination {10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 2000} If input is 5000, Then output of the program should me the number of minimum notes.

5.     Write a Program to implement Knapsack Problem using Greedy Method 

6.     Write a Program to Implement Prim's Algorithm in C++ 

7.     Write a Program to implement Kruskal's Algorithm

9.     Coin change Problem - You are given coins of different denominations and a total sum. Coins are – (1, 2, 5, 10) and Sum = 18.  Find the number of ways we get the sum using coins. Number of coins are unlimited and any denomination of coin can be used any number of time. Write a program to find the number of possible ways we get the sum using the above given coin denomination.

10.    Rod cutting Problem - Given a rod of length n, and an array that contains the prices of all the pieces smaller than n, determine the maximum profit you could obtain from cutting up the rod and selling its pieces. Write a program to find the maximum profit for the values given below. Suppose that we have a rod of length 5, and an array containing the length(1,2,3 and 4 ) and price(2,5,7 and 8 ) of the pieces.

11.    Equal Sum Partition problem – A set has been given and you have to find that can the given set can be  divided into two subsets such that sum of both subsets are equal. Write a program to find if it is possible to divide a given set into two subsets with equal sum.
